    "Welcome to the Recurrent Neural Network Project in the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "In this project you will perform time series prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network regressor.  In particular you will re-create the figure shown in the notes - where the stock price of Apple was forecasted (or predicted) 7 days in advance.  In completing this exercise you will learn how to construct RNNs using Keras, which will also aid in completing the second project in this notebook.\n",

    "First we must load in our time series - a history of around 140 days of Apple's stock price.  Then we need to perform a number of pre-processing steps to prepare it for use with an RNN model.  First off, it is good practice to normalize time series - by normalizing its range.  This helps us avoid serious numerical issues associated how common activation functions (like tanh) transform very large (positive or negative) numbers, as well as helping us to avoid related issues when computing derivatives.\n",

    "Here we normalize the series to lie in the range [0,1] [using this scikit function](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html), but it is also commonplace to normalize by a series standard deviation."

    "## 2.1  Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will implement a popular Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to create an English language sequence generator capable of building semi-coherent English sentences from scratch by building them up character-by-character.  This will require a substantial amount amount of parameter tuning on a large training corpus (at least 100,000 characters long).  In particular for this project we will be using a complete version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic book The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we train a machine learning model to generate text automatically, character-by-character?  *By showing the model many training examples so it can learn a pattern between input and output.*  With this type of text generation each input is a string of valid characters like this one\n",
    "\n",
    "*dogs are grea*\n",
    "\n",
    "while the corresponding output is the next character in the sentence - which here is 't' (since the complete sentence is 'dogs are great').  We need to show a model many such examples in order for it to make reasonable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fun note:** For those interested in how text generation is being used check out some of the following fun resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Generate wacky sentences](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya/rnn.html) with this academic RNN text generator\n",
    "\n",
    "- Various twitter bots that tweet automatically generated text like[this one](http://tweet-generator-alex.herokuapp.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- the [NanoGenMo](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016) annual contest to automatically produce a 50,000+ novel automatically\n",
